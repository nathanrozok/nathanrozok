# üëã Hi, I'm Nathan Rozok ‚Äî AI Product Manager | Ethical Innovator | Strategic Thinker

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a product-minded leader with over a decade of experience bridging business goals with technical execution ‚Äî currently focused on building **AI-powered, data-driven solutions** that deliver real value without compromising efficiency or ethics.

### üß† What I Do

As an **AI Product Manager**, I specialize in:
- Translating complex business needs into scalable, ML-backed product roadmaps
- Leading cross-functional teams through the full product lifecycle
- Applying Lean, Agile, and ethical frameworks to AI/ML deployment
- Designing and supporting **TinyML** and edge intelligence projects, bringing AI to real-world environments with resource constraints

I believe AI should **enhance decision-making**, not overcomplicate it ‚Äî and that great product leadership means knowing *what* to build, *why*, and *how to deliver it responsibly*.

### üå± Principles I Follow

- **Clarity over complexity**: A good product should make smart feel simple.
- **Ethics by design**: AI should be explainable, fair, and aligned with human goals.
- **Iteration with intent**: Build fast, but with a purpose and a plan.
- **Collaboration wins**: No solo genius replaces a great team with great feedback loops.
